## üöÄ Git Fundamentals for Newcomers

### What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** that tracks changes in files and coordinates work among multiple people. Think of it as a sophisticated "save game" system for your code that:

- **Tracks Every Change**: Records what changed, when, and who made the change
- **Enables Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously
- **Provides Safety**: Never lose your work - everything is backed up and recoverable
- **Manages Versions**: Switch between different versions of your project instantly

### Core Git Concepts

**Repository (Repo)**: A project folder that Git tracks. Contains all your files plus Git's tracking data.

**Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Like a "save point" with a descriptive message.

**Branch**: An independent line of development. Like working on a separate copy of your project.

**Remote**: A version of your repository stored elsewhere (like GitHub). Enables backup and collaboration.

**Working Directory**: The files you're currently editing on your computer.

**Staging Area**: A preparation zone where you choose which changes to include in your next commit.

### Basic Git Workflow

1. **Modify files** in your working directory
2. **Stage changes** you want to commit (`git add`)
3. **Create a commit** with your staged changes (`git commit`)
4. **Push commits** to remote repository (`git push`)
5. **Pull updates** from others (`git pull`)

## Core Git Operations

### üîç Repository Status & Information

#### Git Status Operations

##### Check Repository Status

```bash
git status
```

**Purpose**: Display working tree status, staged changes, and untracked files

**Practical Example**: Daily workflow status check

```bash
# Check current repository state
git status

# Output:
# On branch main
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
# 
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
#         modified:   src/config.json
# 
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#         modified:   docs/README.md
```

**Maintenance Notes**: Use `git status --porcelain` for scripting and automation

#### Show Working Tree Status

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

**Purpose**: Machine-readable status output for automation scripts

**Practical Example**: PowerShell integration for repository monitoring

```powershell
# PowerShell wrapper for Git status checking with detailed comments
# This function provides a clean status check suitable for scripts and automation

# Get machine-readable Git status (no colors, consistent format)
# --porcelain flag returns status in a format easy to parse programmatically
$GitStatus = git status --porcelain

# Check if there are any changes (modified, added, deleted, or untracked files)
if ($GitStatus) {
    # Repository has pending changes - alert user with yellow warning
    Write-Host "Repository has uncommitted changes:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    
    # Display each changed file with its status code
    # Status codes: M=Modified, A=Added, D=Deleted, ??=Untracked
    $GitStatus | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "  $_" }
    
    # Optional: Count different types of changes
    $ModifiedCount = ($GitStatus | Where-Object { $_ -match "^\s*M" }).Count
    $UntrackedCount = ($GitStatus | Where-Object { $_ -match "^\?\?" }).Count
    Write-Host "Summary: $ModifiedCount modified, $UntrackedCount untracked files" -ForegroundColor Cyan
} else {
    # No changes detected - repository is clean and ready
    Write-Host "Repository is clean - no uncommitted changes" -ForegroundColor Green
}
```

### üìù File Operations & Staging

#### Add Files to Staging Area

##### Add Specific Files

```bash
git add <file-path>
```

##### Add All Changes

```bash
git add .
```

**Purpose**: Stage changes for commit preparation

**Practical Example**: Selective staging workflow with detailed explanations

```bash
# === SELECTIVE STAGING APPROACH ===
# This approach gives you precise control over what gets committed

# Step 1: Stage specific files that are logically related
# Only stage files that belong to the same feature or bug fix
git add src/database/connection.js     # Main implementation file
git add tests/unit/connection.test.js  # Related test file

# Step 2: Review what you've staged before proceeding
# This helps ensure you're committing the right changes together
git status
# Expected output will show staged files under "Changes to be committed:"

# Step 3: If you're confident about all current changes, stage everything
# Use this when all your changes are part of the same logical update
git add .  # Stages all modified, deleted, and new files in current directory

# === VERIFICATION COMMANDS ===
# Always verify your staging before committing
git diff --staged          # Review exactly what will be committed
git status --short         # Compact view of staged vs unstaged changes
```

**Maintenance Notes**: Use `git add -p` for interactive staging of partial changes

#### Interactive Staging

```bash
git add -p
```

**Purpose**: Interactively stage portions of files for granular commit control

**Practical Example**: Splitting large changes into logical commits

```bash
# === INTERACTIVE STAGING FOR PRECISE COMMITS ===
# This powerful feature lets you commit parts of files, not just whole files

# Start interactive staging for a file with multiple unrelated changes
git add -p src/large-refactor.js

# Git will show you each "hunk" (section of changes) and ask what to do
# This allows you to create focused, logical commits from mixed changes

# === INTERACTIVE STAGING OPTIONS ===
# Git will present each change and wait for your decision:

# y - YES, stage this hunk (include in next commit)
# n - NO, don't stage this hunk (leave for later)
# s - SPLIT this hunk into smaller pieces (for more precision)
# e - EDIT this hunk manually (advanced users)
# q - QUIT interactive staging (stage nothing more)
# a - ACCEPT all remaining hunks in this file
# d - DECLINE all remaining hunks in this file
# ? - HELP, show all available options

# === PRACTICAL WORKFLOW EXAMPLE ===
# Scenario: You fixed a bug AND added a new feature in the same file
# Goal: Create separate commits for bug fix and feature addition

# 1. Use interactive staging to select only bug fix changes
git add -p src/user-auth.js  # Select 'y' for bug fix hunks, 'n' for feature hunks
git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication timeout issue"

# 2. Stage the remaining feature changes
git add -p src/user-auth.js  # Now select 'y' for the feature hunks
git commit -m "feat: add two-factor authentication support"
```

### üíæ Commit Operations

#### Create Commits

##### Standard Commit

```bash
git commit -m "commit message"
```

##### Commit with Detailed Message

```bash
git commit -m "Brief summary" -m "Detailed description of changes"
```

**Purpose**: Record changes to the repository with descriptive messages

**Practical Example**: Professional commit workflow with detailed explanations

```bash
# === PROFESSIONAL COMMIT MESSAGE STRUCTURE ===
# A well-structured commit message tells the complete story of your changes

# STRUCTURE: <type>(<scope>): <short description>
# 
# <detailed body explaining what and why>
# 
# <footer with issue references and additional context>

# Professional commit with comprehensive context
# The first line is a concise summary (50 characters or less)
git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication middleware" -m "
=== WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED ===
- Implement JWT token validation for secure sessions
- Add rate limiting for login attempts (prevents brute force)
- Include comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Update API documentation with new authentication endpoints

=== WHY THESE CHANGES WERE MADE ===
Enhances application security by implementing industry-standard
authentication practices. Rate limiting protects against attacks
while JWT tokens provide stateless session management.

=== TESTING AND VALIDATION ===
All authentication tests passing (unit + integration)
Manual testing completed on staging environment
Security review approved by team lead

=== PROJECT MANAGEMENT ===
Resolves: #123 (User Authentication Epic)
Related: #124 (Rate Limiting Requirements)
Testing: All authentication tests passing
"

# === COMMIT MESSAGE BEST PRACTICES ===
# 1. First line: Clear, concise summary (imperative mood)
# 2. Blank line after first line
# 3. Body: Explain WHAT and WHY, not HOW
# 4. Use bullet points for multiple changes
# 5. Reference issues and pull requests
# 6. Include testing notes
```

**Maintenance Notes**: Follow conventional commit format for automated changelog generation

#### Amend Previous Commit

```bash
git commit --amend -m "Updated commit message"
```

**Purpose**: Modify the most recent commit message or add forgotten changes

**Practical Example**: Correcting recent commit issues with safety considerations

```bash
# === AMENDING COMMITS: COMMON SCENARIOS ===
# WARNING: Only amend commits that haven't been pushed to shared repositories!
# Amending changes commit history, which can cause issues for collaborators

# SCENARIO 1: Forgot to include a file in the last commit
# This happens when you commit but realize you missed a related file
git add forgotten-file.js           # Stage the forgotten file
git commit --amend --no-edit        # Add to last commit without changing message
# --no-edit keeps the existing commit message unchanged

# SCENARIO 2: Need to fix the commit message
# Use this when you made a typo or want to improve the message clarity
git commit --amend -m "fix: Correct typo in user validation logic"
# This replaces the entire commit message with the new one

# SCENARIO 3: Need to modify both files and message
git add additional-fix.js            # Stage more changes
git commit --amend -m "fix: Comprehensive user validation improvements"
# This adds the new file AND updates the message

# === SAFETY CHECKS BEFORE AMENDING ===
# 1. Verify you haven't pushed the commit yet
git log --oneline -5                 # Check recent commits
git status                           # Ensure clean working directory

# 2. If you already pushed, consider a new commit instead:
# git commit -m "fix: Additional validation improvements"
# This preserves history and avoids conflicts with collaborators
```

## File Change Visualization

### üìä Diff Operations

#### View Changes Between Versions

##### Working Directory vs Staged

```bash
git diff
```

##### Staged vs Last Commit

```bash
git diff --staged
```

**Purpose**: Visualize changes before committing for quality control

**Practical Example**: Pre-commit review workflow

```bash
# Review unstaged changes
git diff

# Review staged changes before commit
git diff --staged

# Compare specific files
git diff HEAD~1 src/config.js
```

#### Advanced Diff Visualization

##### Word-Level Changes ("Show me exactly which words changed")

```bash
# Highlight individual word changes instead of entire lines
# Perfect for text documents, documentation, and small code changes
git diff --word-diff=color

# === WHEN TO USE WORD-LEVEL DIFFS ===
# - Reviewing documentation changes
# - Checking variable name changes
# - Analyzing configuration file modifications
# - Reviewing commit messages or comments
```

##### Ignore Whitespace Changes ("Focus on content, not formatting")

```bash
# Ignore whitespace-only changes (spaces, tabs, blank lines)
# Useful when code was reformatted but logic didn't change
git diff --ignore-blank-lines --ignore-space-change

# More whitespace ignore options:
git diff --ignore-all-space          # Ignore ALL whitespace differences
git diff --ignore-space-at-eol       # Ignore whitespace at end of lines
```

**Purpose**: Enhanced change visualization for detailed code review and quality control

**Practical Example**: Documentation and code review workflow

```bash
# === REVIEWING DOCUMENTATION CHANGES ===
# Scenario: Someone updated README.md with formatting and content changes

# Step 1: See word-level changes for precise content review
git diff --word-diff=color README.md
# Output shows: [deleted words] and {+added words+} in context
# This makes it easy to spot exactly what content changed

# Step 2: If there are many formatting changes, focus on content
git diff --ignore-blank-lines --ignore-space-change README.md
# This filters out spacing/formatting changes to show real content changes

# === REVIEWING CODE CHANGES ===
# Scenario: Code was auto-formatted but you want to see logic changes

# Ignore whitespace to focus on actual code changes
git diff --ignore-all-space src/utils.js
# This shows functional changes without being distracted by indentation

# === COMBINED FLAGS FOR MAXIMUM CLARITY ===
# Get the clearest view of meaningful changes
git diff --word-diff=color --ignore-blank-lines --ignore-space-change
# This combination gives you:
# - Word-level precision
# - Content focus (ignoring formatting)
# - Clean, readable output
```

**Maintenance Notes**: Use `--stat` flag for change summaries in automated reports

#### Statistical Change Summary

```bash
git diff --stat
```

**Purpose**: Numerical summary of changes for reporting and analysis

**Practical Example**: Change impact assessment

```bash
# Get statistical overview of changes
git diff --stat

# Output:
# README.md                          | 15 +++++++++++----
# src/components/UserAuth.js         | 42 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# tests/integration/auth.test.js     | 28 ++++++++++++++++++++++
# 3 files changed, 81 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
```

### üîç Change History Analysis

#### Log Operations

##### Standard Log

```bash
git log --oneline
```

##### Detailed Log with Graph

```bash
git log --graph --pretty=format:'%h -%d %s (%cr) <%an>' --abbrev-commit
```

**Purpose**: Analyze repository history and track development progress

**Practical Example**: Project milestone analysis

```bash
# Recent commits overview
git log --oneline -10

# Visual branch history
git log --graph --oneline --all

# Commits by specific author
git log --author="John Doe" --oneline --since="1 week ago"
```

#### Blame Analysis

```bash
git blame <file>
```

**Purpose**: Track line-by-line authorship and modification history

**Practical Example**: Code responsibility tracking

```bash
# Analyze authorship of specific file
git blame src/authentication.js

# Blame with commit details
git blame -C -C -C src/authentication.js
```

**Maintenance Notes**: Use blame for code review and responsibility assignment

## Branch Management

### üåø Understanding Git Branches

**What is a branch?** Think of a branch as an independent line of development - like working on a separate copy of your project. You can experiment, make changes, and develop features without affecting the main codebase.

**Why use branches?** They enable:

- **Parallel Development**: Multiple features can be developed simultaneously
- **Isolation**: Experimental changes don't break the main code
- **Collaboration**: Team members can work on different features independently
- **Safe Experimentation**: Try new ideas without risk

#### Branch Creation and Management

##### List Branches ("What branches exist?")

```bash
# Show local branches (branches on your computer)
git branch
# The branch with * is your current active branch

# Show ALL branches (local + remote)
git branch -a
# Remote branches appear as "remotes/origin/branch-name"

# Show branches with their last commit info
git branch -v
# Helpful to see which branches are active or stale
```

##### Create New Branch ("Start a new line of development")

```bash
# Method 1: Create branch but stay on current branch
git branch <branch-name>
# Creates the branch but doesn't switch to it

# Method 2: Create branch and switch to it immediately (RECOMMENDED)
git checkout -b <branch-name>
# Most common approach - create and switch in one command

# Method 3: Modern Git syntax (Git 2.23+)
git switch -c <branch-name>
# Newer, clearer command that does the same thing
```

**Purpose**: Organize development work into logical, isolated feature branches

**Practical Example**: Complete feature development workflow

```bash
# === FEATURE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW ===
# Scenario: Adding user authentication to your application

# Step 1: Start from the main branch (ensure you have latest code)
git switch main                     # Switch to main branch
git pull origin main               # Get latest changes from remote

# Step 2: Create a feature branch with descriptive name
git switch -c feature/user-authentication
# Branch names should be descriptive: feature/description, bugfix/issue, etc.

# Step 3: Verify you're on the new branch
git branch                         # Current branch marked with *
# Should show: * feature/user-authentication

# Step 4: Do your development work (edit files, test, etc.)
# Make commits as you progress:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add login form component"
git commit -m "feat: implement JWT authentication"

# Step 5: When feature is complete, prepare to merge
git switch main                    # Switch back to main
git pull origin main              # Get any new changes
git switch feature/user-authentication  # Back to feature branch
git merge main                     # Integrate any new main changes

# === BRANCH ORGANIZATION BEST PRACTICES ===
# Use consistent naming conventions:
# feature/short-description    (new functionality)
# bugfix/issue-description     (fixing bugs)
# hotfix/critical-fix          (urgent production fixes)
# release/version-number       (preparing releases)
# experiment/idea-name         (trying new approaches)
```

#### Branch Switching

##### Modern Git Switch

```bash
git switch <branch-name>
git switch -c <new-branch-name>  # Create and switch
```

**Purpose**: Navigate between different development contexts

**Practical Example**: Multi-feature development

```bash
# Switch to existing branch
git switch feature/database-optimization

# Create and switch to new branch
git switch -c hotfix/security-patch

# Switch back to main branch
git switch main
```

#### Branch Cleanup

##### Delete Local Branch

```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>  # Safe delete
git branch -D <branch-name>  # Force delete
```

##### Delete Remote Branch

```bash
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```

**Purpose**: Maintain clean repository structure and remove obsolete branches

**Practical Example**: Post-merge cleanup

```bash
# Delete merged feature branch
git branch -d feature/completed-feature

# Delete remote branch after merge
git push origin --delete feature/completed-feature

# Clean up remote tracking branches
git remote prune origin
```

### üîÑ Merge Operations - Bringing Changes Together

**What is merging?** Merging combines changes from one branch into another. It's like taking the work you did on a feature branch and integrating it into the main codebase.

**Types of merges:**

- **Fast-forward**: Simply moves the branch pointer (no merge commit)
- **Three-way merge**: Creates a merge commit that combines two branches
- **No-fast-forward**: Always creates a merge commit (preserves branch history)

#### Branch Merging

##### Standard Merge ("Git decides the merge type")

```bash
# Merge specified branch into current branch
# Git automatically chooses fast-forward or three-way merge
git merge <branch-name>

# === WHAT HAPPENS DURING MERGE ===
# 1. Git finds the common ancestor of both branches
# 2. Git applies changes from both branches
# 3. If no conflicts: merge completes automatically
# 4. If conflicts exist: Git pauses and asks you to resolve them
```

##### No-Fast-Forward Merge ("Always create a merge commit")

```bash
# Force creation of merge commit even when fast-forward is possible
# This preserves the branch history and makes feature integration visible
git merge --no-ff <branch-name>

# === WHY USE --no-ff? ===
# - Preserves feature branch history in main branch
# - Makes it clear when features were integrated
# - Easier to revert entire features if needed
# - Better for team collaboration and code review tracking
```

**Purpose**: Integrate changes from feature branches into main development line safely and systematically

**Practical Example**: Complete feature integration workflow with safety checks

```bash
# === SAFE FEATURE INTEGRATION WORKFLOW ===
# Always follow this sequence to avoid integration problems

# Step 1: Prepare main branch (get latest changes)
git switch main                     # Switch to target branch
git pull origin main               # Get latest changes from remote
git status                         # Verify clean working directory

# Step 2: Pre-merge validation
git log --oneline feature/user-dashboard  # Review feature commits
git diff main..feature/user-dashboard     # See all changes that will be merged

# Step 3: Perform the merge with explicit merge commit
git merge --no-ff feature/user-dashboard
# Git will open editor for merge commit message
# Default message is usually good: "Merge branch 'feature/user-dashboard'"

# Step 4: Verify merge was successful
git log --oneline -5               # Check recent commits
git status                         # Ensure clean state

# Step 5: Push merged changes
git push origin main

# Step 6: Clean up (optional but recommended)
git branch -d feature/user-dashboard      # Delete local feature branch
git push origin --delete feature/user-dashboard  # Delete remote feature branch

# === HANDLING MERGE CONFLICTS ===
# If merge fails due to conflicts:
# 1. Git will show conflict markers in affected files
# 2. Edit files to resolve conflicts (remove markers, choose correct code)
# 3. Stage resolved files: git add <conflicted-file>
# 4. Complete the merge: git commit (don't use -m, let Git use default message)
```

**Maintenance Notes**: Use `--no-ff` to preserve branch history in main branches

## Advanced Git Workflows

### üîß Stash Operations

#### Temporary Work Storage

##### Create Stash

```bash
git stash
git stash push -m "Work in progress on feature X"
```

##### Apply Stash

```bash
git stash apply
git stash pop  # Apply and remove from stash stack
```

**Purpose**: Temporarily store uncommitted changes for branch switching

**Practical Example**: Emergency hotfix workflow

```bash
# Stash current work for emergency fix
git stash push -m "WIP: User dashboard improvements"

# Switch to hotfix branch
git switch hotfix/critical-security-patch

# After hotfix, return to feature work
git switch feature/user-dashboard
git stash pop
```

#### Stash Management

##### List Stashes

```bash
git stash list
```

##### Show Stash Contents

```bash
git stash show -p stash@{0}
```

**Purpose**: Manage multiple temporary work states

**Practical Example**: Multi-context development

```bash
# List all stashed work
git stash list

# Review specific stash contents
git stash show -p stash@{1}

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{0}

# Clean up old stashes
git stash drop stash@{2}
```

### üéØ Worktree Management

#### Multiple Working Directories

##### Add Worktree

```bash
git worktree add <path> <branch-name>
```

##### List Worktrees

```bash
git worktree list
```

**Purpose**: Maintain multiple working directories for parallel development

**Practical Example**: Parallel feature development

```bash
# Create worktree for feature branch
git worktree add ../feature-authentication feature/user-auth

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove completed worktree
git worktree remove ../feature-authentication
```

**Maintenance Notes**: Use worktrees for testing multiple branches simultaneously

---

## Maintenance & Housekeeping

### üßπ Repository Cleanup

#### Garbage Collection

##### Standard Cleanup

```bash
git gc
```

##### Aggressive Cleanup

```bash
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
```

**Purpose**: Optimize repository performance and reclaim disk space

**Practical Example**: Monthly maintenance routine

```bash
# Regular maintenance
git gc --auto

# Deep cleanup for large repositories
git gc --aggressive --prune=now

# Verify repository integrity
git fsck --full
```

#### Remote Cleanup

##### Prune Remote References

```bash
git remote prune origin
```

##### Clean Merged Branches

```bash
git branch --merged | grep -v "main\|master" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
```

**Purpose**: Remove obsolete remote references and merged branches

**Practical Example**: Post-release cleanup

```bash
# Remove stale remote branches
git remote prune origin

# Delete local branches that have been merged
git branch --merged main | grep -v "main" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d

# Verify cleanup results
git branch -a
```

### üìä Repository Statistics

#### Size and Performance Analysis

##### Repository Size

```bash
git count-objects -vH
```

##### Large File Analysis

```bash
git rev-list --objects --all | git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' | sed -n 's/^blob //p' | sort --numeric-sort --key=2 | tail -10
```

**Purpose**: Monitor repository health and identify optimization opportunities

**Practical Example**: Performance audit workflow

```bash
# Check repository size and object count
git count-objects -vH

# Identify largest files in history
git rev-list --objects --all | \
  git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' | \
  sed -n 's/^blob //p' | \
  sort --numeric-sort --key=2 | \
  tail -10

# Check recent commit sizes
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" | wc -l
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### üö® Common Issues and Solutions

#### **Merge Conflicts**

**Issue**: Conflicting changes prevent automatic merge

**Solution**:

```bash
# View conflict status
git status

# Edit conflicted files manually
# Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>

# After resolving conflicts
git add <resolved-file>
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

**Prevention**: Regular branch synchronization and small, focused commits

#### **Accidental Commits**

**Issue**: Committed wrong changes or to wrong branch  

**Solution**:

```bash
# Undo last commit, keep changes staged
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit, unstage changes
git reset HEAD~1

# Completely remove last commit (dangerous)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**Prevention**: Use `git diff --staged` before committing

#### **Lost Commits**

**Issue**: Commits appear to be missing after reset or rebase

**Solution**:

```bash
# Find lost commits
git reflog

# Recover specific commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Create branch from lost commit
git branch recovery-branch <commit-hash>
```

**Prevention**: Regular backups and careful use of destructive commands

### üîç Diagnostic Commands

#### Repository Health Check

##### Integrity Verification

```bash
git fsck --full
```

##### Configuration Review

```bash
git config --list --show-origin
```

**Purpose**: Diagnose repository issues and verify configuration

**Practical Example**: Troubleshooting workflow

```bash
# Check repository integrity
git fsck --full

# Review all configuration settings
git config --list --show-origin

# Check remote connections
git remote -v

# Verify branch tracking
git branch -vv
```

---

## Best Practices

### üìã Development Workflow Standards

#### Commit Message Guidelines

**Format**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Types**:

- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Testing changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Example**:

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): Add multi-factor authentication support

- Implement TOTP token generation
- Add backup code functionality
- Update user registration flow
- Include comprehensive test coverage

Closes #145"
```

#### Branch Naming Conventions

**Format**: `<type>/<description>`

**Examples**:

- `feature/user-authentication`
- `bugfix/memory-leak-fix`
- `hotfix/security-patch`
- `release/v2.1.0`

#### Code Review Workflow

1. **Create Feature Branch**: `git switch -c feature/new-functionality`
2. **Develop and Commit**: Small, focused commits with clear messages
3. **Push for Review**: `git push origin feature/new-functionality`
4. **Code Review**: Address feedback in additional commits
5. **Merge**: Use `--no-ff` to preserve branch history
6. **Cleanup**: Delete merged branches

### üîê Security Considerations

#### Sensitive Data Protection

**Never Commit**:

- Passwords and API keys
- Configuration files with secrets
- Binary files and large assets
- Personal information

**Use .gitignore**:

```gitignore
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.production

# API keys and secrets
config/secrets.json
*.key
*.pem

# Build artifacts
dist/
build/
node_modules/

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
```

**Maintenance Notes**: Regularly audit repository for accidentally committed secrets

---

## Performance Optimization

### ‚ö° Repository Performance

#### Large Repository Strategies

##### Partial Clone

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none <repository-url>
```

##### Shallow Clone

```bash
git clone --depth=1 <repository-url>
```

**Purpose**: Reduce clone time and disk usage for large repositories

**Practical Example**: CI/CD optimization

```bash
# Fast clone for CI builds
git clone --depth=1 --single-branch --branch=main https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Partial clone for development
git clone --filter=blob:limit=1m https://github.com/user/large-repo.git
```

#### Configuration Optimization

##### Performance Settings

```bash
# Enable parallel processing
git config --global core.preloadindex true
git config --global index.version 4

# Optimize for Windows
git config --global core.fscache true
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

**Purpose**: Improve Git performance on different operating systems

## Integration Examples

### üîó PowerShell Integration - Automating Git Workflows

**Why integrate Git with PowerShell?**

- **Automation**: Create scripts that handle repetitive Git tasks
- **Validation**: Add safety checks and validation to Git operations
- **Reporting**: Generate status reports across multiple repositories
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Combine Git operations with other PowerShell tasks

**Prerequisites**: Ensure Git is installed and available in your PowerShell PATH

                Untracked = $UntrackedFiles        # Count of untracked files
                Staged = $StagedFiles              # Count of staged changes
                Unstaged = $UnstagedFiles          # Count of unstaged changes
                TotalChanges = $Status.Count       # Total number of changed files
                Clean = $Status.Count -eq 0        # True if no changes pending
                LastCommit = git log -1 --format="%h %s" 2>$null  # Latest commit info
            }
